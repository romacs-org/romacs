/// variation selectors (incl. the supplement), and tag characters (subdivision
/// flag tag sequences). Deliberately EXCLUDES bidi controls (LRM/RLM), spaces
/// (ZWSP/ZWNBSP), line/paragraph separators, and C1 controls — those stay
/// glyphless so they still display as their own replacement glyph.

///   emoji codepoint is — probe with a canonical emoji (U+1F600) to reach
///   the color emoji font (an emoji keycap is digit + U+FE0F + U+20E3; the
///   digit alone would pick a monochrome font).
/// - Otherwise the first glyph-bearing non-ASCII character, skipping
///   zero-width joiners/selectors that don't determine the font.
