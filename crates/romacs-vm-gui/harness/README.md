# Live VM G1a oracle harness

Run from the repository root **after the parent has built both binaries**:

```sh
python crates/romacs-vm-gui/harness/live_oracle.py \
  --binary /absolute/path/to/romacs-vm-gui \
  --oracle /absolute/path/to/romacs-gui-oracle \
  --output /absolute/path/to/new-artifact-directory
```

The harness never invokes Cargo. The output directory must not exist. Defaults
use the already-installed private labwc and wlr-randr from the oracle capture
harness; override `--labwc` and `--wlr-randr` if those store paths change.
`grim`, ImageMagick (`magick`), and the Liberation Mono Regular font file must
be available. Python uses only the standard library. `--runtime-root` must be
short enough for Unix sockets; its default is the supplied Hermes scratch root.

## Binary contract and independent geometry

* Each run receives `--wayland /absolute/private/socket`. The compositor has
  **one 400×300 headless output**, configured explicitly with wlr-randr. Its
  window rule maximizes the client without decorations. Capture the whole
  output; there is **no inferred crop, image alignment, or renderer geometry**.
* Startup is `Ωμέγα Hello\n`, with only `Hello` red `#ff0000`, default white
  `#ffffff`, background black `#000000`, no cursor/fringe, origin **(0,0)**.
  Font: **Liberation Mono, 20px**.
* The binary writes exactly one JSON object per stdout line, with no log lines:
  `{"ready":true,"presentation":1}` after startup presentation activation.
* Only after capturing and judging the initial frame, the harness sends this
  stdin JSON line (the actual JSON encoder preserves Unicode):
  ```json
  {"source":"(with-current-buffer \"*g1a*\" (goto-char (point-max)) (insert \"Δ\"))"}
  ```
* The reply must contain `result` and a strictly newer positive integer
  `presentation`, **after activation**. `error` is forbidden. The harness then
  captures the second frame, which must have `Δ` at row 1, column 0.
* Replies are ordering signals only, never inputs to the pixel judge.
  ImageMagick's independent FreeType measurement of the declared font file at
  density 72 and point size 20 determines cell width, ascent, and row height
  `ceil(ascent + abs(descent))`. The installed Liberation Mono measures
  **width 12, ascent 17, descent 6, row height 23**. Thus the two baselines are
  y=17 and y=40. These metrics are recorded and explicitly passed in each
  oracle spec. Neither capture content nor renderer reports tune them.

The harness runs three fresh compositor/client pairs:

1. normal, no GC arguments;
2. `--gc-floor 1` (override the floor with harness `--gc-floor N`);
3. `--gc-floor 1 --gc-between-snapshot-and-paint`.

Every run judges before and after captures using `oracle check SPEC CAPTURE`
(exit **0** required). Against the *after* spec it also requires exit **1**,
not an error exit, for three mutants derived from that run's real captures:

* red Hello ink changed to green, preserving antialias coverage;
* the whole captured image shifted right by exactly one pixel on black;
* the actual before capture substituted, so `Δ` is absent.

Low-GC and forced-GC captures must additionally match normal-run RGB pixels
exactly for each phase. A successful result is `summary.json` with `pass: true`
and three successful runs. Failure writes `pass: false` plus the error and
retains diagnostics. Each run saves launch arguments, replies, request,
compositor/client logs, captures, mutants, and every oracle result. Runtime
HOME/XDG directories and sockets are disposable; no ambient DISPLAY or
WAYLAND_DISPLAY is inherited. Processes are terminated (then killed on timeout)
on all paths.

The text claim is **exact up to Liberation Mono's identical glyph pairs**;
`H/Η` and `o/ο` occur in this scene. GC counters, buffer versions, and unresolved
font counters are not pixel assertions. The binary's forced-GC implementation
and core-free dependency/symbol checks remain the parent's responsibility.

## Focused verification, without Cargo

```sh
G1A_ORACLE=/absolute/path/to/romacs-gui-oracle \
  python -m unittest discover -s crates/romacs-vm-gui/harness -v
```

Without `G1A_ORACLE`, the real-oracle unit test is explicitly skipped. It renders
an **explicitly synthetic ImageMagick test image** to verify independent metrics,
spec wiring, and all three actual oracle rejections. It is **not** a live
compositor/editor acceptance result or a substitute for running the command at
the top.

Implementation-time checks:

* Red-first: unit discovery initially failed because `live_oracle` did not yet
  exist (an import failure, **not** a behavioral red acceptance test).
* All **6 focused tests passed** with the existing s107 debug oracle, including
  the synthetic positive-before/after and three negative controls.
* The private compositor path was exercised with `/usr/bin/false` deliberately
  used as the client. wlr-randr configured the output and client launch was
  reached; the harness correctly returned exit 1 / `pass: false` with
  `binary stdout closed (exit=1)`. This is only a fail-closed launch preflight.
* The integrated worker subsequently built the real binary and ran all three
  live variants successfully; see `../evidence/current-oracle-live/summary.json` and
  `../README.md` for the exact commands, movement proof, and diagnostic limits.
  This harness does not invoke Cargo, a full gate, or Git publication.

# Package parity: pinned GNU beside `--loadup`

`parity_live.py` runs pinned GNU pgtk and `romacs-vm-gui --loadup` at once,
each in its own headless labwc with a private HOME, types the same keys into
both and compares the state both report after every step through
`parity_probe.el`; `report.json` records every difference, the geometry
apart, and each step's wall time and, with `--perf`, its `instructions:u`.
It never invokes Cargo.  Each harness names its workflows, its private trees
and its comparison policy in its docstring:

* `gnosis_parity_live.py`: the owner's gnosis workflows (dashboard, search
  and tags, review, adding and editing a thema), each engine on its own copy
  of a Gnosis database.
* `hermes_parity_live.py`: the owner's hermes checkout, read-only against
  the running dashboard at 127.0.0.1:9119 (dashboard, session browser and
  search, a session's history), its token discovered by hermes and never
  reported.
* `eshell_parity_live.py`: `M-x eshell` from *scratch* through Eshell's own
  `ls`, `echo`, `cd` and `pwd`, `cat` of a file several screens long, an
  external `printf`, `C-c C-c` on an external `sleep 5`, `M-p`, `C-c C-u`
  and `exit`, both engines in one small work directory.  `--debug-on-error`
  sets `debug-on-error` in both inits.
